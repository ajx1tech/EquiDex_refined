# EquiDex

> Fix harmful bias before AI systems impact real people.

EquiDex is an open source AI bias auditing platform that wraps any AI decision system as middleware, silently logs every decision, calculates discrimination statistics in real time, and generates compliance reports on demand.

Most auditing tools investigate bias after the fact — once a year, after thousands of people have already been harmed. EquiDex catches it before it scales.

Built for the GDG PromptWars 2026 National

🚀 Live Deployment & Infrastructure Optimization
This repository represents a heavily refined, live-deployed version of the base EquiDex platform.
Cloud Architecture: Successfully deployed the backend via Google Cloud Run and the frontend via Vercel.
Firebase Integration: Configured and linked Firebase hosting for secure, scalable routing and data management.
Enhanced Security: Implemented a non-root user environment in Docker and restructured the cloud configuration to dynamically resolve paths, preventing local file-write crashes in the cloud environment.
Testing: Integrated generate_dataset.py to create 10,000 synthetic candidate profiles with intentional bias thresholds to actively test the AI's auditing capabilities.

**Status:** Fully functional · Backend + Frontend complete

## The Problem

Companies use AI to filter job applications, approve loans, and make medical decisions. These systems often discriminate silently — rejecting Mohammed Hassan and accepting James Smith with identical qualifications, purely based on name or ethnicity. Nobody notices because it happens automatically, at scale, with no paper trail.

**EquiDex makes the invisible visible.**

## Demo Results

In our hiring AI demo, EquiDex detected:

| Group | Acceptance Rate |
|---|---|
| Caucasian | 100% |
| East Asian | 100% |
| Hispanic | 25% |
| South Asian | 21.9% |
| African American | 21.9% |
| Middle Eastern | 20.8% |

**Caucasian candidates are accepted 4.8× more often than Middle Eastern candidates with identical qualifications.**

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | FastAPI + Python 3.13 |
| Database | SQLite (dev) / Firebase Firestore (prod) |
| AI | Gemini 2.5 Flash |
| Frontend | Vanilla JS + Chart.js 4.x |

## Dashboard Features

The EquiDex dashboard provides **6 professional interactive charts**:

| Chart | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Overall Acceptance Rate | Doughnut with center % | Quick glance at accept/reject ratio |
| Acceptance Rate by Group | Horizontal Bar | Color-coded by severity per demographic group |
| Applications Received | Vertical Bar | Volume distribution with distinct palette |
| Accepted vs Rejected | Stacked Bar | Breakdown showing where rejections cluster |
| Acceptance Rate Over Time | Area Line | Trend monitoring across audit dates |
| Bias Disparity by Dimension | Polar Area | Severity-coded disparity across all dimensions |

All charts update dynamically when switching between dimension tabs (name origin, age group, ethnicity).

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Assassin61/Fairprobe.git
cd Fairprobe
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up your API keys

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here
```

Get your key: [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) (free)

### 4. Start the backend

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

### 5. Start the frontend

```bash
python -m http.server 3000 --directory frontend

## Running the Demo

1. Open the dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
2. Click **Run / Upload** in the sidebar
3. Click **Run Demo Audit** — generates 500 candidates through a biased hiring AI
4. Return to the **Dashboard** — all 6 charts populate automatically
5. Switch between dimension tabs (name origin, age group, ethnicity)
6. Use the **Latest Audit** action cards:
   - **Analyse Bias** — Gemini interprets the discrimination patterns
   - **Generate Report** — formal compliance report with legal references
   - **Summarize** — plain English executive summary

## Configuration

EquiDex is fully config-driven. Edit `fairprobe.config.yaml` to adapt it to any company or domain — no code changes needed.

```yaml
company: "Your Company"
domain: "employment"         # employment, banking, healthcare

database:
  type: "sqlite"             # switch to "firebase" for production
  path: "./fairprobe.db"

ai:
  provider: "gemini"
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash"

thresholds:
  high_bias: 30              # flag if acceptance gap exceeds 30%
  medium_bias: 15
```

---

## Deployment

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for full instructions covering:
- **Firebase Firestore** — production database
- **Google Cloud Run** — backend API hosting
- **Firebase Hosting** — frontend hosting (primary)
- **Vercel** — frontend hosting (alternative)

Both Firebase Hosting and Vercel provide automatic TLS/HTTPS. Cloud Run also serves over HTTPS by default. No manual certificate configuration needed for production.

---

## Key Design Decisions

- **FastAPI calculates all statistics** — Gemini only interprets pre-calculated results, never raw data
- **Candidate cache is permanent** — `demo_candidates.json` accumulates believable data across runs
- **Config-driven** — no hardcoding anywhere, one YAML file adapts EquiDex to any company
- **Adapter pattern** — swap SQLite for Firebase by changing one line in config
- **On-demand AI calls only** — Gemini is called max 3 times per demo to conserve credits
- **6 professional charts** — doughnut, horizontal bar, vertical bar, stacked bar, line, polar area
